Custom Hooks
useOnlineStatus.jsx
This custom hook checks the online status of the user and provides feedback accordingly. It uses the browser's navigator.onLine property to determine the user's connectivity status.

useRestrauntMenu.jsx
This custom hook fetches and manages restaurant menu data. It makes API calls to retrieve the menu information and handles loading and error states, providing a clean and reusable way to fetch menu data across different components.

Utils
constants.jsx
This file contains constant values used throughout the project, such as API endpoints, default settings, and configuration options. By centralizing these values, it ensures consistency and makes it easier to update them when needed.

AppStore.jsx
This file sets up the Redux store for state management. It integrates the various reducers and middleware required for managing the application's state.

CartSlices.jsx
This file contains Redux slices for managing the cart state. It defines actions and reducers for adding, removing, and updating items in the cart, as well as calculating the total cost.

UserContext.jsx
This file sets up the Context API for managing user state and providing global access to user-related data and functions. It simplifies state management by avoiding prop drilling and making user data accessible from any component.

Custom Hooks
useOnlineStatus.jsx
This custom hook checks the online status of the user and provides feedback accordingly. It uses the browser's navigator.onLine property to determine the user's connectivity status.

Navigate to the project directory:

sh
Copy code
cd YumYum
Install the dependencies:

sh

Usage
Browsing Restaurants
On the home page, users can browse through a list of available restaurants.
Each restaurant is displayed as a card with its name, image, rating, and a short description.
Clicking on a restaurant card will navigate to the detailed menu page of the selected restaurant.
Viewing Restaurant Menu
The detailed menu page displays the restaurant's menu categories and items.
Users can browse through different categories, such as appetizers, main courses, and desserts.
Each menu item includes details such as the name, description, price, and an option to add the item to the cart.
Managing the Cart
Users can add items to their cart from the restaurant menu page.
The cart component allows users to view the items they have added, update quantities, and remove items if needed.
The total cost of the items in the cart is calculated and displayed at the bottom of the cart.
Placing an Order
Once the user is satisfied with their selection, they can proceed to checkout.
The checkout process will guide the user through entering their delivery information and payment details.
After placing the order, the user will receive a confirmation message and details about the expected delivery time.
Online Status Detection
The application includes a custom hook (useOnlineStatus.jsx) that checks the user's online status.
If the user goes offline, the application will display a message indicating that they are offline and may not be able to place an order until they are back online.
Error Handling
The application includes robust error handling to ensure a smooth user experience even when issues arise.
If an error occurs, such as a failed API request, the user will see an error message with information about the issue.
